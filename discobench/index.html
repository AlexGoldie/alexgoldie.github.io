    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Benchmarks for algorithms discovery are: too easy; not open-ended; don't focus on <i>algorithm</i> transfer; or need full codebases to get started! DiscoBench has a modular setup, a way to measure algorithm transfer, and a huge breadth of tasks! This should enable better research in algorithm discovery, and a much more open-ended landscape for evaluating AI research agents!</p>
    

    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>

    <p>The goal of AI Scientist systems is to, eventually, automate AI research itself. To be able to do this, we need to be able to <i>measure</i> the ability of AI scientists. While current benchmarks do exist, they are fundamentally limited in a number of ways. DiscoBench is a new benchmark and research environment for algorithm discovery agents which seeks to overcome these difficulties. DiscoBench is designed in a scalable fashion, with the issues of current benchmarks in mind, such that we hope it can remain pertinent for a long time. Below, we explain <i>why</i> DiscoBench is so useful, and some of the tasks that are currently implemented in it; expect these to grow over the next few months!</p>


    <h2>The Problem With Current Benchmarks</h2>



      <ul>
      <li><p><b>Close-Ended Problems</b>: Most current algorithm discovery benchmarks (MLEBench, Others etc.) focus on small-scale Kaggle-style problems, wherein problems are very different to cutting-edge research challenges. Ideally, we want a benchmark which does <b>not</b> have a right answer, and there is always space for improvement.</p></li>  

      <li><p><b>Poor Evaluation</b>: Like in all machine learning, proper evaluation requires a <i>train-test</i> dataset separation. Most preexisting benchmarks do this on the model-level - i.e., a successful algorithm is one which trains a model to generalise to a test dataset. This misses the correct train-test boundary; we are find algorithms on the meta-scale, and so rather than finding models which transfer to test, we should be measuring the transfer of <b>algorithms</b> to train models in a completely new domain.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Limited Diversity</b>: Existing benchmarks require manually creating <i>every single</i> problem, which requires a lot of time and results in significant repetition!</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Bias To The Initialisation</b>: Because of how they are implemented, most preexisting benchmarks require initialising a codebase from a fully working, preexisting implementation. Initialising an agent in a local minimum can be very difficult to escape, and limits the creativity that we hope to elicit from AI research agents.</p></li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Table showing difference between current common benchmarks</h1>
    <h2>What is DiscoBench?</h2>

      <p>
        DiscoBench is a new benchmark and research environment for algorithm discovery in AI. Its main contributions are as follow:
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li><b>Modular File System</b>: To massively expand task-diversity, we implement each task in a <i>modular</i> fashion. For every ML codebase we use, we identify a series of small <i>modules</i> which we can mark as <i>editable</i> (the LLM is fed an empty file) or <i>fixed</i> (the code uses a prewritten file). For example, in one task the modules could be the <b>network architecture</b>, the <b>loss function</b> and the <b>optimiser</b>. For the cost of implementing a single codebase with $$n$$ modules, we can get $$n!-1$$ different possible tasks - and when a module is <i>editable</i>, we can start the agent off with a near-empty file, so we don't get biased too close to the initialisation!</li>  
      
      <li><b>Train-Test Split</b>: Our benchmark is implemented with a clear <i>Train-Test</i> distinction. In DiscoBench, we define this split clearly - we evaluate the transferability of the <i>algorithms</i> written by agents, meaning we test how well a learning algorithm generalises for training a completely new model! It turns out, it's really easy to overfit algorithms to specific problems (which isn't that useful when we want to solve AI)!</li>  

      <li><b>Open-Ended Task Space</b>: In DiscoBench, we focus on up-to-date codebases and unsaturated datasets and environments. Given these represent real research problems, without a "correct" answer, they are inherently open-ended problems that rely on creativity and effective contextual reasoning to maximise performance in.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>A Figure showing something to do with modules</h2>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <h2>Using DiscoBench</h2>
  
  <p>Getting started with DiscoBench is simple. Full installation instructions are available in our <a href="url" style="color: #6366f1;">repository</a>.</p>

  <h3>Quick Start</h3>

  <p><strong>1. Install DiscoBench</strong></p>
  <pre style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;"><code>pip install discobench</code></pre>

  <p><strong>2. Create a task</strong></p>
  <pre style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;"><code>discobench.create_task(task_domain="task_domain")</code></pre>
  <p>This creates a <code>requirements.txt</code> and a full modular codebase.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Evaluate your code</strong></p>
  <pre style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;"><code>discobench.create_task(task_domain="task_domain", test=True)</code></pre>
  <p>This builds a new codebase for your test environments.</p>

  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>To control which modules and datasets to use, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a <code>task_config</code> following the templates in the repository</li>
    <li>Build a dictionary with the relevant arguments</li>
  </ul>
</div>
    
    <h2>Example Tasks</h2>

      We implement a number of tasks from a range of AI research domains in DiscoBench. While these are continuously being iterated on and added to, we include a description of a subset of our tasks, and their modules, below.

    <details>
      <summary><b>On-Policy RL</b></summary>
      <p><b>Modules:</b> Optimiser, Loss, Network Architecture, Training Loop</p>
      <p>Starting from code set up for a standard actor-critic RL training loop, the agent must find algorithms which maximise the return of an RL agent policy. We support different RL environments, such as MinAtar, Brax and Craftax.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Image Classification</b></summary>
      <p><b>Modules:</b> Optimiser, Loss, Network Architecture</p>
      <p>Using code designed for training an image classifier, the agent must find algorithms which maximise the accuracy of image classification. We support a range of different datasets, from MNIST (simple) to CIFAR100.</p>
        </details>


    <details>
      <summary><b>Machine Unlearning</b></summary>
      <p><b>Modules:</b> Test Test Test </p>
      <p>Who said algorithm discovery can't help with AI safety? Unlearning involves trying to train a pre-trained model to maintain certain behaviours, while removing others. The agent must develop algorithms which maximise the desired capabilities while minimised the undesired capabilities or knowledge. This is a multi-objective task, in which the agent is given a bunch of different feedback signals to optimise internally.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Protein Docking</b></summary>
      <p><b>Modules:</b></p>
      <p>What is this task? Want to include it because it's so cool!</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Unsupervised Environment Design</b></summary>
      <p><b>Modules:</b> Level Sampler, Training Step, Training Loop, Hyperparameter Config</p>
      <p>Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) involves training an RL actor to be robust to different levels from a particular environment. The LLM agent must develop algorithms to maximise the performance of an RL actor on a held out set of environments.</p>
    </details>
